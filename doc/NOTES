Notes:
1.  The code will probably move to C++11 standards on the next release.
	If this will pose a problem for you, please let us know.
2.  We hope to add BP on the next release
3.  We would like to encorporate non-CTBN structured representations of
	continuous-time processes.  If you have one and want to contribute,
	please let us know.
4.  There are some additional speed increases for exact inference that can
	be realized if the number of unobserved variables is always very small.
	If this would be useful to you, please let us know.
